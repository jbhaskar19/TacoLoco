About

This is simple implementation for Tacoc Loco - getTotal for the billing module.

I have used JSP HTMl CSS Javascript for UI
Tomcat 9.0 server
Eclipse 2020
Ajax call to controller
Using JSON Request/Response format


Description:

Consume the Post Method =>EndPoint:http://localhost:8080/TacoLoco/total
Full flow with UI =>EndPoint:http://localhost:8080/TacoLoco/

Features:
UI has a drop down to choose types of tacos from and enter the number of tacos .
on clicking the "add item" button items are added to the bill.

The user can remove spefic items from the order by clickinh the "remove" button.

Once the "Place Order" button is clicked, the request hits the controller which calculates the total and posts back to the index.jsp page.

If more than 4 tacos are ordered then a discount of 20% is offered.

"Payment Proceess" button is provided for future implementation.
